# A sample MetaWeblog RPC handler. Bear in mind that you will need to rewrite most of it.
#
# Define the standard methods for MetaWeblog API here. If you have a valiation problem or somesuch
# within the method just raise from there, exceptions will be translated into RPC fault codes.
#
# You will need to take a look at (and override) get_entry and friends to retrofit that to your own engine.
#
# Entry struct
#
# A fundamental unit of the MT/MW API is the Entry struct (a Hash). Return that Hash
# anytime an entry struct is required. Here a short intro on the fields of the struct (you can use
# both symbols and strings for keys):
#   title, for the title of the entry;
#   description, for the body of the entry;
#   dateCreated, to set the created-on date of the entry;
#   In addition, Movable Typeâ€™s implementation allows you to pass in values for five other keys:
#   int mt_allow_comments, the value for the allow_comments field;
#   int mt_allow_pings, the value for the allow_pings field;
#   String mt_convert_breaks, the value for the convert_breaks field;
#   String mt_text_more, the value for the additional entry text;
#   String mt_excerpt, the value for the excerpt field;
#   String mt_keywords, the value for the keywords field;
#   String mt_basename, the value for the slug field;
#   array mt_tb_ping_urls, the list of TrackBack ping URLs for this entry;
#
# If specified, dateCreated should be in ISO.8601 format.
# Also note that most blogging clients will have BIG issues if you supply non-UTC timestamps, so if you
# are using ActiveRecord timezone support (and you should!) take care to do all of your RPC operations
# with all timezones switched to UTC.
